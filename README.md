# Basic Calculator using Python

## Description
A Python-based calculator performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Handles division by zero and invalid choices.

## Features
1) Accepts user input for operation choice and numbers

2) Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

3) Handles division by zero with a proper error message

4) Handles invalid operation choices

5) Uses if-elif-else conditional logic for decision-making

Learning Outcomes:
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, and error management in Python. It helped me develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for more complex programming and AI projects.

Technologies Used: Python 3.x, Google Colab

## How to Run
Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab and run the code cell.
